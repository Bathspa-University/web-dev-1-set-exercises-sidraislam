            <p>"This is a fantastic period drama with a twist - clever music too & gets you guessing the artists! You will definitely want to watch it one after the other."- Jayne</p>
            <p>" A perfect movie to watch with your partner! What I love the most about this movie is the mannerism! Even when Daphne and Simon were not getting on, their greetings were respectful towards each other." - Esther</p>
